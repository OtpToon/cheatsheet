Grid Design: columns, rows, gutter, margin
(usually 12 or 16 columns and 4ish rows, gutter is significantly smaller than row/column)
(responsive: pc 12, tablet 6, movile 4 column grid)
whitespace: passive and active

Remember, the reasons we design using grids are:
-Promote consistency within our designs
-Properly align elements on our page
-Provide ample spacing between content
Remember a grid is made up of:
-Columns
-Gutters
-Margins
Spacing is incredibly important within a design to ensure:
-Elements have ample room to breathe
-Denote emphasis on certain parts of a page
-Promote harmonious patterns and rhythms within your designs
